=============

<p>A drop-in stylesheet with common styles for old, nonstandard websites and applications.</p>

<p>This stylesheet has been created while working with many small one-page websites that require changes or updates. Applying rudimentary styles was usually a waste of time that messed the entire alignment or layout due to the way they were built (bad practices rampant), so I had to develop a common naming convention that didn't interfered with their current styles and naming schemes.</p>
